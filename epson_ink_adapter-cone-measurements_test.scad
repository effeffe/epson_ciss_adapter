/*
    Design of an adapter to fill ciss tanks using Epson 102 series or similar
    
    The idea is to remove the cap of the ink tank we want to refill, position the adapter and then place the bottle to fill. Lift the bottle once the desired ink level has been reached.
    Ideally, there should be an adapter per ink colour, which should be washed with water and dried after use.

/*
* NEED to measure the followings:
* tank hole diameter
* tank hole ring cut diameter (optional) - il gradino che c'e' nel buco per intendersi
* epson refill inlet diameter
*/

/*comments on first attempt:
* C1. cone is good, but a cylinder is still required on the bit, as the tip of it should go all the way in for about 0.5-1cm (0.75 should be good
* C2. the connection with the ink bottle is good, but 0.5cm more would be perfect
* C3. the air hole is too much on the side, and is quite small for the ink to pass through in case of leakage. it should go all the way in too! (i.e. shift it? place it diagonally?)
