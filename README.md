# epson_ciss_adapter
Adapter for generic ciss tanks for original epson bottles (102 series and similars)


The idea is to create two adapters, open source, that can be modified and adapted to your own ciss tank.

## Background
Continuous Ink Supply Systems (CISSs) are appliances that supply ink to your printer without the need of cartridges. There are several benefits to this, both enviromental (no cartridges needed, just ink bottles) and economical (ink bottles are much cheaper than cartridges). These can be OEM (like Epson EcoTank series) or custom made (using cartridge printers and mounting custom ciss kits, often found on aliexpress).

While it is true that using non-oem inks can degrade your printer head, using oem inks in your custom CISS should actually mitigate the issue. Using OEM inks can actually prolong the life of your printer head, hence the only damage to it could arise from badly mounted or defective systems.

## Why this project
An example of Epson oem ink bottles is the Epson 102 series, which come with a mess-free ink pouring system. While this is true if you are using an EcoTank, they actually make a mess when poured into a custom system.


The main purpose of this project is to create an adapter to these bottle range, which can be 3D printed and adapted to any CISS tank.

## State of the project
Currently work in progress, at the moment the inlet cylinder has been designed with arbitrary dimensions. These should be verified, as well as the efficacy of the connection cylinder.
